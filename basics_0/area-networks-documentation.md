- Low latency
- Usually implemented as a single IP subnet in TCP/IP networking
- Typically owned, controlled, and managed by a single organization

### Technologies

LANs primarily use the following technologies:

1. **Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)**: The most common LAN technology, using twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable, or fiber optic media.
2. **Token Ring**: A legacy technology where computers access the network through a token-passing system.

### Structure

A typical LAN consists of:
- Network devices (computers, printers, etc.)
- Network interface cards (NICs)
- Switches or hubs
- Routers (for connecting to other networks)

## Network Topologies

Network topology refers to the arrangement of elements within a network. The choice of topology impacts performance, reliability, and scalability.

### Physical vs. Logical Topology

- **Physical Topology**: The actual physical layout of network devices and cables
- **Logical Topology**: The way data flows through the network, which may differ from the physical arrangement

### Common Topologies

    ▼           │
┌───┐         ┌─┴─┐
│ A │         │ D │
└─┬─┘         └───┘
  │             ▲
  ▼             │
┌───┐         ┌───┐
│ B │────────►│ C │
└───┘         └───┘
```

**Characteristics**:
- Each device connects to exactly two other devices
- Data travels in one direction
- Used in legacy Token Ring networks and SONET
- Failure of one device can impact the entire network
- Less common in modern networks

#### Mesh Topology

```
┌───┐         ┌───┐
│ A │─────────│ D │

┌─┴─┐   ┌─┴─┐  ┌─┴─┐
│ B │───│ F │──│ C │
└───┘   └───┘  └───┘
```

**Characteristics**:
- Devices are interconnected with multiple paths
- High redundancy and fault tolerance
- Expensive to implement and maintain
- Complex routing

#### Hybrid Topology

A combination of two or more basic topologies.

**Characteristics**:
